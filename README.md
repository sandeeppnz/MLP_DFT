# Fourier-based approach to represent Neural Networks for datamining

The proposed system aims to implement a forward-feed multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with the backpropagation training algorithm. The Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) algorithms is designed and implemented to transform the MLP model to a condensed representation.
